## bfi-wholegrain
Repository for Matlab codes of my master thesis - investigation of biomarkers for whole grain cereal intake.

Most of the codes and algorisms were produced by my supervisor Gözde Gürdeniz during her PhD and postdoc work in University of Copenhagen. I modified them and adapt to my master thesis.

#Installing
These codes were based on Matlab and a Matlab package (pls toolbox). Pls toolbox is a commercial software developed based on Matlab.
