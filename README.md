## bfi-wholegrain
Repository for Matlab codes of my master thesis - investigation of whole grain cereal intake biomarkers.
Most of the codes and algorisms were produced by my supervisor Gözde Gürdeniz. I modified them and adapt to my master thesis.

#Installing
These codes were based on Matlab and a Matlab package (plstoolbox).
