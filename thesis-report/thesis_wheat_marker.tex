includes three steps: 
(1) a cytochrome P450-mediated $\omega$-oxidation of the alkyl side chain to form hydroxylated ARs, 
(2) further oxidation of the hydroxylated intermediates to generate carboxylated ARs, and 
(3) $\beta$-oxidation of the side chain to produce hydrophilic metabolites (Figure 1).14 Ross et al. 

first reported 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5-DHBA) and 3- (3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (3,5-DHPPA) as the major AR metabolites in humans in 2004.11 Several studies have shown that both 3,5-DHBA and 3,5-DHPPA had longer apparent half-lives (10-12 h) than their parent ARs, indicating they have the potential to reflect longer term WG wheat and rye intake.

However, 3,5-DHBA and 3,5-DHPPA are not unique to ARs and have been reported from other food sources.15
