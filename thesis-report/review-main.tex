\begin{abstract}
Due to lacking objective food exposure measurement, epidemiologic studies showed mixed results on whole grains' health beneficial effects.
Meanwhile, increasing evidence showed each whole grain type could benefit health differently. 
In order to accurately quantify whole grain exposure, there is a demand to discover intake biomarkers for each whole grain species.
This mini review referred the systematic literature review guidelines and examined biomarkers for whole grain barley and whole grain wheat intake.
For whole grain barley, no intake biomarker has been reported.
For whole grain wheat, combining total alkylresorcinol and homologous ratio of C17:0/C21:0 was proposed as biomarkers to measure whole grain wheat intake.
Other promising intake biomarkers were summarized as well.
