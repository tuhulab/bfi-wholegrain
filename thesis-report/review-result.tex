\subsection{WG barley}
The literature search got 129 records after removing duplicate records from merged 3 database search results. However, within them, none of the studies directly investigated WG barley intake biomarkers. This could be explained by limited consumption of barley in population. Although barley is the 4th most produced cereal grains worldwidely. Most of them is used for brewing or feed. Approximately only 4\% is directly consumed\cite{Baik2008}.

When the scope expanded to animal studies, the search results still did not show any direct research about BFIs. Most of animal studies were interested in how barley feed can benefit the growth of animals or quality improvement of animal-source products\cite{ISI:000272990200002,Foster2003}.

A 2-month intervention study\cite{DeAngelis2015} incorporated 75\% refined drum wheat and 25\% WG barley. The fecal samples showed significant change in microbiota and metabolome after intervention\cite{DeAngelis2015}. However, no specific metabolite can indicate WG barley intake.

ARs and their metabolites may not indicate WG barley intake. Several observation studies\cite{ISI:000309032000011,ISI:000259554500019} investigated correlation between ARs metabolites and whole grain intake. Although these studies tried to cover more whole grain species, for example, one study\cite{ISI:000259554500019} listed 7 types of commonly consumed WGs in American populations in the \acrfull{ffq}\footnote{Dark breads, High-fiber or bran cereals, Cooked cereals and grits, Regular granola, Granola bars and cereal bars, Plain popcorn (no butter) or low-fat microwave popcorn, Buttered or gular microwave popcorn}, barley was not solely listed. Therefore, although ARs and their metabolites got good correlation with these 'Whole-grain intake'. Readers should be cautious to apply these markers to \acrshort{wg} barley intake. 
In addition, ARs concentration in cereal barley is much lower compared with \acrshort{wg} wheat and rye, with similar concentration with refined wheat and rye flours (Table-\ref{table:ars_in_plant}).

Most search results focused on barley's \textit{effect biomarkers} as defined by Dragsted\cite{Dragsted2017} and Gao\cite{Gao2017}, such as bowel health indicators\cite{Bird2008}, postprandial glucose and insulin response\cite{Ames2015}, lipid profiles and \acrfull{cvd} markers\cite{Marungruang2018}, etc. However, in these intervention studies, compliance monitoring lacked objective markers.

Further search results in food chemistry, cereal science and plant science showed some compounds exclusively present in barley. These could give hints for further identification. The results were summarized in Table-\ref{table:candidate_biomarker_barley}.

\end{table}
To conclude, barley, especially \acrshort{wg} barley attracted a lot of interest due to its health beneficial effects for chronic disease. However, due to barley's limited consumption in the population, currently there is no reported biomarkers can indicate its intake. A lot of sparse information was reported from cereal and food chemistry could give hints for identification and validations of \acrshort{wg} barley's intake biomarkers.

\subsection{WG wheat}
\subsubsection{Overview}
The literature search got 312 results after removing duplicate records from merged results. Some articles were found from the references of searched results. Two intervention studies and one observation study were included in the table. 

Surprisingly, very few results were reported because WGs seems to be the most mature and hotspot area of \acrshort{bfis} research. 
In fact, within searched results, most intervention studies used \acrshort{wg} diet containing several types of \acrshort{wg} cereals. Most commonly, using \acrshort{wg} rye and wheat, report ARs as intake biomarkers for \acrshort{wg} rye and wheat.
In observational studies, food frequency questionnaires naturally cause confounding distingushing each sub-type cereal. because subjects had difficulty recalling the food frequencies.
Those not specific were listed in appendix. 
However, still surprising to us, few researches were studied to distinguish wheat from other cereal grains.



\subsection{Alkylresorcinols and homologous ratio C17:0/C21:0}
The AR homologous ratio C17:0/C21:0 was the major reported, validated and applied biomarker for \acrshort{wg} wheat intake. 

This marker was first reported by cereal scientists in 2004 to distinguish \acrshort{wg} rye and wheat cereal \cite{Chen2004}. In cereal grains, rye has homologous C17:0/C21:0 ratio close to 1.0, while wheat around 0.1, durum wheat around 0.01.

Further this marker was proposed by nutritionists to be capable of distinguishing \acrshort{wg} rye and wheat intake. In 2005, Linko\cite{ISI:000376712600013} first investigated using this biomarker in human plasma to measure food exposure. The intervention study showed the potential of this marker AR C17:0/C21:0 to distinguish \acrshort{wg} wheat and rye in diet in healthy postmenopausal women. 
For rye-dominated diet, the ratio was 0.84 and for WG wheat-dominated diet, the ratio was around 0.53. 
Further in 2007, Linko-Parvinen validated this marker in healthy adults by an intervention study \cite{10.1093/jn/137.5.1137}.
In plasma, the value was 0.1 after WG wheat intake, 0.6 after WG rye intake. In erythrocytes, the value was 0.06, 0.33 respectively after WG wheat and rye intake. This study also implied ARs could be transported in human plasma lipoproteins.

However, the AR homologues ratio C17:0/C21:0 was not significantly different between \acrshort{wg} diet and refined cereal diet as reported by Landsberg\cite{ISI:000255012000007}. But WG diet and refined diet can be distinguished by total ARs concentration in plasma.

An observational study further confirmed the potential of this marker.
In 2014, EPIC\footnote{European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition} cohort study investigated plasma ARs and the C17:0/C21:0 ratio of subjects from 10 European countries. 
The result showed that Greek, Italian, Dutch and UK participants of whom the diet was dominated by wheat, had low C17:0/C21:0 ratio. Whereas Danish, German and Swedish subjects had high C17:0/C21:0 ratio. French and Norwegian subjects had intermediate ratio. These results were correlated with exposure amount in the population.

%\acrshort{ars} (Figure\ref{fig:structure_ars}) and their metabolites (3,5-DHPPTA, 3,5-DHPPA, 3,5-DHBA and 3,5-DHBA glycine) were widely reported, validated and applied biomarkers for WG wheat and rye intake. 
%Total \acrshort{ars} were used as biomarkers for overall \acrshort{wgs} wheat and rye exposure. In order to distinguish \acrshort{wg} wheat and rye. The ratio of C17:0/C21:0 was used. \acrshort{ars}, depending on different milling methods and grain species, varies the concentration and homologues compositions (Table-\ref{table:ars_in_plant}). . The ratio was further proposed as an marker to indicate which cereal dominates in the diet: if the ratio is close to 1.0, rye dominated; close to 0.1, wheat dominates\cite{ISI:000376712600013,Landberg2009}.

\label{table:wheat_intervention}
\end{table}

In \acrfull{wg} source dominated by wheat, total ARs got good correlation with wheat intake. e.g. UK and America. 

Meanwhile, ARs metabolites could also be a potential marker, but may not be a good marker in mixed-ARs source countries since ARs metabolites were not specific to WG wheat. 
ARs from WG rye could also be metabolized to same products causing confounding.

In this study\cite{ISI:000298402100026}, total ARs, rather than the ratio (C17:0/C21:0), were reported as \acrshort{wg} wheat intake biomarkers.
This intervention was conducted in UK. In British population, the major whole grain source is wheat. Rye was rarely consumed. Therefore, plasma ARs got a good correlation with \acrfull{wg} wheat intake.

\subsubsection{Applications in Type II diabetes research}

Combining plasma total ARs concentration and the ratio (C17:0/C21:0) can subjectively estimate \acrshort{wg} wheat and rye intake and approximate the composition.

Two studies already showed the power of \acrshort{bfis} for each sub-type cereal. 

It was observed that, 

The total ARs concentration was not correlated with type II diabetes risk.

higher C17:0/C21:0 ratio (increase of rye intake) is associated with increased insulin sensitivity in a population with metabolic syndrome.

This may imply that, a whole grain diet dominated by rye could be favourable for type II diabetes prevention. 

In EPIC cohort study, an interesting phenomena could also imply XXX. Rye has higher constitutions in Danish populations's WG source (70\%) than Swedish(55\%) on average. However, regarding C17:0/C21:0 ratio, Danish participants in EPIC cohort showed lower value (0.37) than Swedish participants (0.43). 
However, Swedish participants were healthy adults, while participants from Denmark in EPIC study were obese or over-weights subjects. Those participants may have different dietary habits and consume less rye than average Danes. This may imply rye could also be favorable in weight control.

%%%Observation study
Searching results also showed some \textit{Food compound intake biomarkers (FCIBs)} research as defined by Gao\cite{Gao2017} such as phenolic compounds\cite{ISI:000389134200003}, benzoxazinoids\cite{ISI:000394168100034} and phytoestrogen\cite{ISI:000384082300001}. These compounds also present in other food,  not specific for \acrshort{wg} wheat. These results were summarized in Appendix.

Their concentrations varied in different cereal grains. Therefore, a combination of their metabolites could potentially indicate intake of different cereals.
