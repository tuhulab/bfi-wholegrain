In order to clarify each sub-type of cereal's health beneficial effects, it is important to accurately quantify exposure amount of each sub-type. BFIs showed their strengths and potentials in studying WGs. 


it is essential to discover intake biomarker for each sub-type cereal grain.
Currently, most studies showed interest in WG effect biomarkers.

As discussed in \cite{ISI:000447355100002}, one of the challenges in BFIs discovery of WG is that the chemical compositions of most of WGs were not systematically 

due to limited systematic research on phytochemicals
