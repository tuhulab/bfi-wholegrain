%Due to lacking objective food exposure measurement, epidemiologic studies showed mixed results on whole grains' health beneficial effects.
%Alkylresorcinols (ARs) and their metabolites were widely reported, validated and applied biomarkers for whole grain intake.
%However, increasing evidence showed that each sub-type of whole grain could benefit health differently. Therefore, there's a demand to discover more specific BFIs for each whole grain species.
%This mini review referred the systematic BFIs literature review guidelines and examined BFIs for whole grain barley and whole grain wheat intake.
%For whole grain barley, there's no available reported BFIs\footnote{In my project work, I proposed some biomarkers}.
%For whole grain wheat, the ratio of ARs 17:21 was proposed as biomarkers to distinguish wheat and rye intake.
