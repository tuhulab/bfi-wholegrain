Limitation of LC-MS based metabolomics BFIs discovery: 
(1) instruments and their maintainance plus the analytical method development and optimization are expensive.
(2) it always involves clinical or human trail. it is expensive, time and energy consuming
(3) knowledge of researchers: chemistry, food science, nutritional science, human physiology, data analysis and programming is needed.

Metabolites are fluctuating.
