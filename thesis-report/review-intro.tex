Whole grains (WGs) contain a lot of non-nutrient compounds in the bran. 
These non-nutrient compounds might benefit health.

Several dietary guidelines suggested WG intake\cite{Piepoli2016}. 
A recent meta-analysis confirmed high intake of WGs is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all cause and cause specific mortality\cite{Aune2016}. 
Recommendations for \acrshort{wg} intake have often been unclear or inconsistent with regard to the amount and types of whole grain foods that should be consumed to reduce chronic disease and risk of mortality.

Increasing evidence showed different \acrshort{wg} types (such as wheat, rye, oat, barley etc.) could benefit health differently. 
However, classical self-reported measurement tools (e.g. food diaries and food frequency questionnaires) used in observational studies could cause biases and confoundings to distinguish each cereal type.
 
 %due to subjective food exposure measurement based on self-report\cite{ISI:000447355100002}. Using \acrfull{bfis} can potentially measure food exposure in population more objectively with accuracies and details\cite{Scalbert2014}.
%Alkylresorcinols (ARs) and their metabolites were widely reported and validated biomarkers for \acrshort{wgs} intake. 
%In plants commonly consumed for food, \acrshort{ars} only present high amounts in rye and wheat, especially concentrated in their bran parts\cite{arreview2004}. Therefore, \acrshort{ars} have the possibility to be used as biomarkers for whole grain wheat and rye intake.


Discovering \acrshort{bfis} of each whole grain type could potentially provide a tool to accurately quantify their exposures. WGs' health beneficial effects could be further elucidated. 

This mini-review aimed at systematically examining available literatures to obtain information of potential biomarkers for WG barley and wheat intake. This will prioritize further identification and validation of the thesis work.
