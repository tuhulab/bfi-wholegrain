Currently, there's no biomarkers reported for \acrshort{wg} barley intake both in human and animal studies.

Total \acrshort{ars} and their metabolites were reported to potentially indicate \acrshort{wg} wheat and rye intake. The homologues ratio of \acrshort{ars} C17:0/C21:0 was proposed to distinguish which whole grain type dominates in the diet.

Several phytochemicals could potential become candidate markers of \acrshort{wg} wheat and barley intake. However, they need to be further validated.
