%\acrshort{wg} barley attracted a lot of interest due to its health beneficial effects for preventing chronic disease. However, 
None biomarker has been reported for \acrshort{wg} barley intake both from human and animal studies.

Total \acrshort{ars} from plasma can indicate WG rye and wheat intake.
The homologues ratio of \acrshort{ars} C17:0/C21:0 can indicate relative composition of WG rye and wheat. Combing these two markers can objectively indicate \acrshort{wg} wheat intake. This marker has been implemented in several studies and proven its usefulness.
