	abstract = {Background: Studies that use dietary biomarkers to investigate the association between whole-grain intake and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) are lacking. Objective: We examined the association between plasma total alkylresorcinols and the alkylresorcinol C17:0-to-C21:0 ratio, biomarkers of whole-grain wheat and rye intake and relative whole grain rye over whole-grain wheat intake, respectively, and the risk of T2D among Scandinavian men and women. Design: A nested case-control study was established within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study and the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort. Alkylresorcinol concentrations and the ratios of C17:0 to C21:0 were determined in plasma samples from 931 case-control pairs. ORs for T2D were calculated for plasma total alkylresorcinol concentration or C17:0-to-C21:0 ratio in quartiles with the use of conditional logistic regression that was adjusted for potential confounders. Additional analyses with whole-grain wheat and rye intake estimated from food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs) as exposures were also performed. Results: The plasma total alkylresorcinol concentration was not associated with T2D risk (OR: 1.34; 95{\%} CI: 0.95, 1.88) for the highest compared with the lowest quartiles in multivariable adjusted models. However, the C17:0-to-C21:0 ratio was associated with a lower diabetes risk (OR: 0.54; 95{\%} CI: 0.37, 0.78). Analyses with whole-grain intake estimated from FFQs yielded similar results. Conclusions: Total whole-grain wheat and rye intake, reflected by alkylresorcinols in plasma, was not associated with a lower risk of T2D in a population with high whole-grain intake. In contrast, the proportion of whole-grain rye to whole-grain wheat intake, indicated by the plasma C17:0-to-C21:0 ratio, was inversely associated with T2D. This suggests that whole-grain intake dominated by rye may be favorable for T2D prevention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Few studies have used biomarkers of whole-grain intake to study its relation to glucose metabolism. We aimed to investigate the association between plasma alkylresorcinols (AR), a biomarker of whole-grain rye and wheat intake, and glucose metabolism in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Participants were 30-65 years of age, with body mass index 27-40 kg/m(2) and had MetS without diabetes. Individuals were recruited through six centers in the Nordic countries and randomized to a healthy Nordic diet (ND, n=96), rich in whole-grain rye and wheat, or a control diet (n=70), for 18-24 weeks. In addition, associations between total plasma AR concentration and C17:0/C21:0 homolog ratio as an indication of the relative whole-grain rye intake, and glucose metabolism measures from oral glucose tolerance tests were investigated in pooled (ND + control) regression analyses at 18/24 weeks. RESULTS: ND did not improve glucose metabolism compared with control diet, but the AR C17:0/C21:0 ratio was inversely associated with fasting insulin concentrations (P=0.002) and positively associated with the insulin sensitivity indices Matsuda ISI (P=0.026) and disposition index (P=0.022) in pooled analyses at 18/24 weeks, even after adjustment for confounders. The AR C17:0/C21:0 ratio was not significantly associated with insulin secretion indices. Total plasma AR concentration was not related to fasting plasma glucose or fasting insulin at 18/24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The AR C17:0/C21:0 ratio, an indicator of relative whole-grain rye intake, is associated with increased insulin sensitivity in a population with MetS.},

	abstract = {Alkylresorcinols with alkyl chains C17:0-C25:0 are abundant in whole-grain wheat and rye. Concentrations in human plasma have been suggested to be biomarkers of dietary whole-grain intake. We measured human plasma, erythrocyte, and lipoprotein alkylresorcinol concentrations and alkylresorcinol homolog distribution, and evaluated the use of plasma alkylresorcinol concentration as a dietary biomarker of whole-grain intake compared with serum enterolactone. A total of 15 subjects (8 women) consumed whole-grain wheat or whole-grain rye crisp bread (∼100 g/d) in a crossover design for 1 wk. The test bread periods were preceded by 1-wk periods of consuming refined wheat bread. Plasma, erythrocyte, lipoprotein alkylresorcinol, and serum enterolactone concentrations were measured before and after each period, and plasma alkylresorcinols and serum enterolactone were measured after habitual diet intake before and 1 wk after the trial. Plasma alkylresorcinols are transported in lipoproteins with VLDL and HDL being the main carriers. AR concentrations in plasma, erythrocytes, and lipoproteins were increased (P $\backslash$$\backslash${\textless} 0.05) by whole-grain wheat bread and even more so with rye crisp bread, although interindividual variation was high. The alkylresorcinol homolog C17:0 to C21:0 ratio in plasma was higher after the whole-grain rye diet period compared with the whole-grain wheat diet period (P $\backslash$$\backslash${\textless} 0.05). Serum enterolactone concentrations were increased significantly by whole-grain rye intake only in men. This is the first report to show that alkylresorcinols in human plasma are mainly transported in lipoproteins. The plasma alkylresorcinol C17:0 to C21:0 ratio reflects intake of whole-grain wheat and rye, and the plasma total alkylresorcinol concentration appears to be a useful biomarker of whole-grain cereal intake.},

	abstract = {Bread is one of the most widely consumed foods. Its impact on human health is currently of special interest for researchers. We aimed to identify biomarkers of bread consumption by applying a nutrimetabolomic approach to a free-living population. An untargeted HPLC-q-TOF-MS and multivariate analysis was applied to human urine from 155 subjects stratified by habitual bread consumption in three groups: non-consumers of bread (n = 56), white-bread consumers (n = 48) and whole-grain bread consumers (n = 51). The most differential metabolites (variable importance for projection a parts per thousand yen1.5) included compounds originating from cereal plant phytochemicals such as benzoxazinoids and alkylresorcinol metabolites, and compounds produced by gut microbiota (such as enterolactones, hydroxybenzoic and dihydroferulic acid metabolites). Pyrraline, riboflavin, 3-indolecarboxylic acid glucuronide, 2,8-dihydroxyquinoline glucuronide and N-alpha-acetylcitrulline were also tentatively identified. In order to combine multiple metabolites in a model to predict bread consumption, a stepwise logistic regression analysis was used. Receiver operating curves were constructed to evaluate the global performance of individual metabolites and their combination. The area under the curve values {\{}[{\}}AUC (95 {\%} CI)] of combined models ranged from 77.8 {\%} (69.1-86.4 {\%}) to 93.7 {\%} (89.4-98.1 {\%}), whereas the AUC for the metabolites included in the models had weak values when they were evaluated individually: from 58.1 {\%} (46.6-69.7 {\%}) to 78.4 {\%} (69.8-87.1 {\%}). Our study showed that a daily bread intake significantly impacted on the urinary metabolome, despite being examined under uncontrolled free-living conditions. We further concluded that a combination of several biomarkers of exposure is better than a single biomarker for the predictive ability of discriminative analysis.},

	abstract = {The bran and particularly the aleurone fraction of wheat are high in betaine and other physiological methyl donors, which may exert beneficial physiological effects. We conducted two randomised, controlled, cross-over postprandial studies to assess and compare plasma betaine and other methyl donor-related responses following the consumption of minimally processed bran and aleurone fractions (study A) and aleurone bread (study B). For both studies, standard pharmacokinetic parameters were derived for betaine, choline, folate, dimethylglycine (DMG), total homocysteine and methionine from plasma samples taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 h. In study A (n 14), plasma betaine concentrations were significantly and substantially elevated from 0.5 to 3 h following the consumption of both bran and aleurone compared with the control; however, aleurone gave significantly higher responses than bran. Small, but significant, increases were also observed in DMG measures; however, no significant responses were observed in other analytes. In study B (n 13), plasma betaine concentrations were significantly and substantially higher following consumption of the aleurone bread compared with the control bread; small, but significant, increases were also observed in DMG and folate measures in response to consumption of the aleurone bread; however, no significant responses were observed in other analytes. Peak plasma betaine concentrations, which were 1.7-1.8 times the baseline levels, were attained earlier following the consumption of minimally processed aleurone compared with the aleurone bread (time taken to reach peak concentration 1.2 v. 2.1h). These results showed that the consumption of minimally processed wheat bran, and particularly the aleurone fraction, yielded substantial postprandial increases in plasma betaine concentrations. Furthermore, these effects appear to be maintained when aleurone was incorporated into bread.},

	abstract = {Whole-grain intake has been reported to be associated with a lower risk of several lifestyle-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, CVD and some types of cancers. As measurement errors in self-reported whole-grain intake assessments can be substantial, dietary biomarkers are relevant to be used as complementary tools for dietary intake assessment. Alkylresorcinols (AR) are phenolic lipids found almost exclusively in whole-grain wheat and rye products among the commonly consumed foods and are considered as valid biomarkers of the intake of these products. In the present study, we analysed the plasma concentrations of five AR homologues in 2845 participants from ten European countries from a nested case-control study in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. High concentrations of plasma total AR were found in participants from Scandinavia and Central Europe and lower concentrations in those from the Mediterranean countries. The geometric mean plasma total AR concentrations were between 35 and 41nmol/l in samples drawn from fasting participants in the Central European and Scandinavian countries and below 23nmol/l in those of participants from the Mediterranean countries. The whole-grain source (wheat or rye) could be determined using the ratio of two of the homologues. The main source was wheat in Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK, whereas rye was also consumed in considerable amounts in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The present study demonstrates a considerable variation in the plasma concentrations of total AR and concentrations of AR homologues across ten European countries, reflecting both quantitative and qualitative differences in the intake of whole-grain wheat and rye.},

	abstract = {Two alkylresorcinol (AR) metabolites, 3, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-propanoic acid (DHPPA), in urine have been suggested as biomarkers of whole grain (WG) and cereal fiber intake but the long-term reproducibility and correlation with habitual intake has not been determined. Therefore, we evaluated the long-term reproducibility of AR metabolites in spot urine samples and investigated their correlation with habitual WG and cereal fiber intake in U.S. women. AR metabolites were analyzed in 104 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study II and WG and fiber intakes were assessed using a FFQ. Long-term reproducibility was assessed by calculating the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) using samples taken 1-3 y (mean 1.8 y) apart. The observed Spearman correlation coefficients (r(S)) and r(S) adjusted for within-participant variation in the biomarker were calculated between WG and fiber intake and biomarkers. The long-term reproducibility was poor for DHBA {\{}[{\}}ICC = 0.17 (95{\%} Cl: 0.05, 0.43)] and modest for DHPPA {\{}[{\}}ICC = 0.31 (95{\%} Cl: 0.17, 0.51)].

Cereal fiber and WG intake were similarly correlated to the biomarkers. DHPPA in spot urine samples reflected WG intake despite relatively low intake of food sources of AR. The poor to modest reproducibility may limit the use of single measurements of these biomarkers in cohort studies in the US, where WG intake is relatively low and has changed over time. But DHPPA in repeated samples may be useful for validating WG intake and assessing compliance in WG intervention studies. J. Nutr. 142: 872-877, 2012.},

	abstract = {Background: Small-scale, short-term intervention studies have suggested that plasma alkylresorcinol (AR) concentrations may be biomarkers of whole grain (WG) wheat and rye intakes. Objective: The objective was to determine whether plasma AR concentrations reflect self-reported WG food intake in a 16-wk WG intervention study and to establish which phenotypic characteristics influence plasma AR concentrations. Design: In a randomized parallel-group dietary intervention study, 316 overweight and obese participants with a WG intake of {\textless}30 g/d were recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: control (no dietary change), intervention 1 (60 g WG/d for 16 wk), or intervention 2 (60 g WG/d for 8 wk followed by 120 g WG/d for 8 wk). Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, 8 wk, and 16 wk for the measurement of plasma lipids and ARs. Results: Plasma samples from 266 study completers were analyzed. Total plasma AR concentrations increased with the WG intervention and could be used to distinguish between control subjects and those who consumed 60 or 120 g WG, but not between those who consumed 60 and 120 g WG. Plasma AR concentrations were higher in men, were positively associated with plasma triglyceride concentrations, and were negatively associated with nonesterified fatty acids. Conclusions: Plasma AR concentrations were correlated with WG intake and could be used to distinguish between low- and high-WG consumers. Sex and plasma lipid concentrations independently influenced plasma AR concentrations, although plasma triglycerides may explain higher concentrations in men.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A multifunctional diet (MFD) targeting subclinical inflammation was developed as a tool to decrease risk factors for cardiometabolic disease in healthy "at-risk" individuals (BMI 25-33 kg/m(2)). MFD contains several components that are degraded in the colon by the microbiota, such as dietary fibers from rye, barley, oats and berries. It also contains soy beans, oily fish and plant stanols. In previous studies, we have observed improved cardiometabolic markers in healthy at-risk individuals after 4-8 week intake of MFD. However, whether these improvements can be associated with changes in the gut microbiota composition has not been investigated. In the present study, we analyzed the gut microbiota before and after an 8-week dietary intervention with MFD. METHODS: Cardiometabolic at-risk individuals (n = 47), between 51 and 72 years old and with a BMI of 25-33 kg/m(2), were given either the MFD or a control diet lacking the functional ("active") components for 8 weeks in a parallel, randomized design. Next-generation sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was used to analyze the gut microbiota composition. RESULTS: The 8-week intervention with MFD did not significantly alter the gut microbiota composition at phylum or genus taxonomic levels, while LEfSE analysis identified increased abundance of Prevotella copri in the MFD group as compared to the control group. Treponema correlated positively with blood pressure. In contrast, Faecalibacterium showed a negative association with blood pressure, while Bilophila appeared to associate with a negative blood lipid profile. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, results from the present study may be used in the further development of effective dietary concepts capable of reducing cardiometabolic risk markers in humans through a targeted modulation of the gut microbial community.

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to determine if the consumption of barley tortillas varying in fibre and/or starch composition affected postprandial glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or peptide YY concentrations. A double-blind, randomised, controlled trial was performed with twelve healthy adults. They each consumed one of five barley tortillas or a glucose drink on six individual visits separated by at least 1 week. Tortillas were made from 100{\%} barley flour blends using five different milling fractions to achieve the desired compositions. All treatments provided 50 g of available carbohydrate and were designed to make the following comparisons: (1) low-starch amylose (0{\%}) v. high-starch amylose (42{\%}) with similar beta-glucan and insoluble fibre content; (2) low beta-glucan (4.5 g) v. medium beta-glucan (7.8 g) v. high beta-glucan (11.6 g) with similar starch amylose and insoluble fibre content; and (3) low insoluble fibre (7.4 g) v. high insoluble fibre (19.6 g) with similar starch amylose and beta-glucan content. Blood was collected at fasting and at multiple intervals until 180 min after the first bite/sip of the test product. Amylose and insoluble fibre content did not alter postprandial glucose and insulin, but high-beta-glucan tortillas elicited a lower glucose and insulin response as compared to the low-beta-glucan tortillas. The tortillas with high insoluble fibre had a higher AUC for GLP-1 as compared to the tortillas with low insoluble fibre, whereas amylose and beta-glucan content had no effect. Results show that processing methods can be used to optimise barley foods to reduce postprandial blood glucose responses and factors that may influence satiety.},

	abstract = {Himalaya 292 (Hordeum vulgare var. Himalaya 292) is a novel hull-less barley variety lacking activity of a key enzyme of starch synthesis giving a grain containing less total starch, more amylose and higher total dietary fibre. Animal trials have shown that Himalaya 292 contains more resistant starch and has greater positive impact on biomarkers of large-bowel health than comparable wholegrain cereal products. The present study compared the effects of foods made from wholegrain Himalaya 292 with those made from wholegrain wheat on faecal biomarkers of bowel health in human subjects. Seventeen male and female volunteers aged 31-66 years consumed similar quantities of Himalaya 292, whole-wheat or refined cereal foods daily for 4 weeks in a randomised cross-over design. Total dietary fibre intakes from weighed food records were 45, 32 and 21 g/d for the Himalaya 292, whole-wheat and refined cereal periods, respectively. Compared with the refined cereal foods, consumption of Himalaya 292 foods resulted in 33 {\%} higher faecal weight, a lowering of faecal pH from 7.24 to 6.98, a 42 {\%} higher faecal concentration and a 91 {\%} higher excretion of butyrate, a 57 {\%} higher faecal total SCFA excretion and a 33 {\%} lower faecal p-cresol concentration. pH and butyrate concentration and excretion were also significantly different compared with wholemeal wheat. It is concluded that consumption of a diet that included foods made from Himalaya 292 supplied more fibre and improved indices of bowel health compared with refined cereal foods and, for some indices, similar wholemeal wheat foods at equivalent levels of intake.},

	abstract = {In human food allergy, with or without concurrent atopy, there may be significant increases in serum allergen-specific IgE. Serological methods have been tried but are not currently recommended for diagnosis of suspected food allergy in dogs. The aim of this study was to investigate humoral immune responses to food antigens in dogs. Serum IgG and IgE antibodies specific for food antigens were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using polyclonal anti-dog IgG and IgE reagents. Antigens tested were beef, chicken, pork, lamb, chicken, turkey, white fish, whole egg, wheat, soybean, barley, rice, maize corn, potato, yeast and cow's milk. Three groups were examined: normal dogs, dogs with atopic dermatitis (AD); and dogs with one of four types of gastrointestinal (GI) disease: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), food-responsive disease, and infectious diarrhoea. Statistically significant differences in food-specific antibodies were not detected between the GI subgroups. There were statistically significant differences in the IgE concentration between the normal dogs, and dogs with atopic or GI disease, for all of the antigens tested. There were statistically significant differences in the average IgG concentrations between the normal dogs, and dogs with atopic or GI disease, for all of the antigens tested, except egg and yeast. The relationship of antigen responses for pooled data was analysed using principle component analysis and cluster plots. Some clustering of variables was apparent for both IgE and IgG. For example, all dogs (normal and diseased) made a similar IgG antibody response to chicken and turkey. Compared with other groups, atopic dogs had more food allergen-specific IgE and this would be consistent with a Th(2) humoral response to food antigens. Dogs with GI disease had more food allergen-specific IgG compared with the other groups. This may reflect increased antigen exposure due to increased mucosal permeability which is a recognised feature of canine intestinal disease.},

The effect of processing on polyphenol content is expressed in the form of retention factor coefficients, or the proportion of a given polyphenol retained after processing, adjusted for change in water content. The result is the first database on the effects of food processing on polyphenol content and, following the model initially defined for Phenol-Explorer, all data may be traced back to original sources.

Three commercial winter wheats, characterized by different hardness and technological quality, and three barleys, including hulled and hull-less types, were selected. Two different protocols of sequential pearling were applied. Pearling of wheat and hull-less barley cultivars gave five fractions (each corresponding to 5{\%} of grain weight) and 75{\%} of the residue. In the case of hulled barley eight pearled fractions and 60{\%} of inner kernel were obtained. In wheat ARs were prevalently located in the 5–10{\%} intermediate fraction, while for barley results varied depending on the cultivar. In the hull-less cultivar, the AR content progressively decreased from the outermost fraction (0–5{\%}) towards the inner layers, while for hulled barley the highest AR content was observed in the 10–15{\%} fraction, evidencing lower amounts in the coarse hull (included in the 0–5{\%} and 5–10{\%} fractions). Based on the different localization of ARs in the cereal kernel, progressive pearling can be employed to obtain enriched fractions that could be used to enhance ingredients and products rich in these bioactive compounds.},

The following average values for total AR content ($\mu$g/gdm) were found: wholegrain wheat flour available only to bakers (490) and to both consumers and bakers (710), refined wheat flour (36), wheat bran (3625), wholegrain spelt wheat flour (650), refined spelt wheat flour (80), wholegrain rye flour (972), refined rye flour (90) and rye bran (2753). The C17:0/C21:0 ratio was 0.1 for wheat and 0.8–0.9 for rye, confirming that it can be used to distinguish between wheat and rye. The AR content of Norwegian refined wheat flour was higher than that of Swedish, due to a consistently higher milling extraction rate in Norway. The content of AR varied from 27 to 2766$\mu$g/gdm in hard bread and 21 to 548$\mu$g/gdm in soft bread. The highest contents were found in bread with a high proportion of wholegrain flour and/or bran, in agreement with earlier studies. There was a good correlation (r=0.91) and a high compliance between calculated and analysed AR levels in soft bread, confirming that AR can be used as a biomarker for wholegrain wheat and/or rye content in a cereal product.},

Metabolically active bacteria were analyzed through pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and community-level catabolic profiles. Pyrosequencing data showed that levels of Clostridiaceae (Clostridium orbiscindens and Clostridium sp.), Roseburia hominis, and Ruminococcus sp. increased, while levels of other Firmicutes and Fusobacteria decreased, from the HSB samples to the HS fecal samples. Community-level catabolic profiles were lower in HSB samples. Compared to the results for HS samples, cultivable lactobacilli increased in HSB fecal samples, while the numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, and Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, and Aeromonas bacteria decreased. Metabolome analyses were performed using an amino acid analyzer and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry solid-phase microextraction. A marked increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as 2-methyl-propanoic, acetic, butyric, and propionic acids, was found in HSB samples with respect to the HS fecal samples. Durum wheat flour and whole-grain barley pasta containing 3{\%} barley beta-glucans appeared to be effective in modulating the composition and metabolic pathways of the intestinal microbiota, leading to an increased level of SCFA in the HSB samples.},

We hypothesized that a high-fiber diet (HFD) containing whole grain rye changes volatile organic compound (VOC) levels in exhaled breath and that consuming a single meal affects these levels. Seven healthy men followed a week-long low fiber diet (17 g/d) and HFD (44 g/d) in a randomized crossover design. A test meal containing 50 g of the available carbohydrates from wheat bread was served as breakfast after each week. Alveolar exhaled breath samples were analyzed at fasting state and 30, 60, and 120 minutes after this meal parallel to plasma glucose, insulin, and serum lipids. We used solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for detecting changes in 15 VOCs. These VOCs were acetone, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, 2-methylbutyric acid, hexanoic acid, acetoin, diacetyl, and phenol. Exhaled breath 2-methylbutyric acid in the fasting state and 1-propanol at 120 minutes decreased (P =.091 for both) after an HFD. Ingestion of the test meal increased ethanol, 1-propanol, acetoin, propionic acid, and butyric acid levels while reducing acetone, 1-butanol, diacetyl, and phenol levels. Both DF diet content and having a single meal affected breathVOCs. Exploring exhaled breath further could help to develop tools for monitoring the metabolic effects of DF. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Methods and results: Two commercially available breads were consumed by 15 participants on three occasions and matched for either the amount of ferulic acid in the bread or the amount of bread consumed. Urine was collected for 48 h from all the volunteers for phenolic metabolite quantification. Blood samples were collected for 24 h following bread consumption in five participants. A total of 12 and 4 phenolic metabolites were quantified in urine and plasma samples, respectively. Metabolites were sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugates of phenolic acids, and high concentrations of ferulic acid-4'-O-sulfate, dihydroferulic acid-4'-O-sulfate, and dihydroferulic acid-O-glucuronide were observed. The bioavailability of ferulic acid was significantly higher from the aleurone-enriched bread when all ferulic acid metabolites were accounted for. Conclusions: The study shows that low amounts of aleurone-enriched bread resulted in equivalent plasma levels of ferulic acid as whole grain bread. This could suggest that, if the absorbed phenolic metabolites after whole grain product intake exert health benefits, equal levels could be reached through the consumption of lower doses of refined products enriched in aleurone fraction.},

No phenoxazinone derivatives could be detected in either plasma or urine. The dominant BX metabolite in both plasma and urine was 2-beta-d-glucopyranosyloxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (HBOA-Glc), even though 2-beta-d-glucopyranosyloxy-4-hydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIBOA-Glc) was the major component in the diet.

The DQ was validated against alkylresorcinol metabolites measured in urine as objective biomarkers of whole grain wheat and rye (WG) intake, and a 4-d estimated food record (FR) was used for relative comparison. Participants (n 61) completed both methods and provided spot urine samples. We found a statistically significant correlation between the DQ and FR for reported whole grain intake and isoflavonoids, as well as for intake of macronutrients, except protein. The correlation coefficient between the two methods was on average r 0.30, lowest for lignans (r -0.11) and highest for alcohol (r 0.65). Reported energy intake was lower in the DQ compared with FR (8523 v. 9249 kJ (2037 v. 2211 kcal), respectively; P = 0.014). Bland-Altman plots showed an acceptable agreement; most cases were within the limits (95 {\%} CI) of agreement on reported energy intake, as well as intake of macronutrients, except protein (which was underestimated in the DQ compared with the FR). The correlation of alkylresorcinol with WG intake was statistically significant in the DQ (r 0.31, P = 0.015), but not in the FR (r 0.18, P = 0.12) and the weighted. was 0-29 and 0.11, respectively. In conclusion, the results showed that the DQ have a reasonable validity for measuring WG intake and most nutrients, and, after some adjustments regarding protein intake assessment have been made, the DQ will be a promising tool.},

Aided by novel profiling technologies, the biomarker research field is undergoing rapid development and new putative biomarkers are continuously emerging in the scientific literature. However, the existing concepts for classification of biomarkers in the dietary and health area may be ambiguous, leading to uncertainty about their application. In order to better understand the potential of biomarkers and to communicate their use and application, it is imperative to have a solid scheme for biomarker classification that will provide a well-defined ontology for the field. In this manuscript, we provide an improved scheme for biomarker classification based on their intended use rather than the technology or outcomes (six subclasses are suggested: food compound intake biomarkers (FCIBs), food or food component intake biomarkers (FIBs), dietary pattern biomarkers (DPBs), food compound status biomarkers (FCSBs), effect biomarkers, physiological or health state biomarkers). The application of this scheme is described in detail for the dietary and health area and is compared with previous biomarker classification for this field of research.},

Metabolically active bacteria were analyzed through pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and community-level catabolic profiles. Pyrosequencing data showed that levels of Clostridiaceae (Clostridium orbiscindens and Clostridium sp.), Roseburia hominis, and Ruminococcus sp. increased, while levels of other Firmicutes and Fusobacteria decreased, from the HSB samples to the HS fecal samples. Community-level catabolic profiles were lower in HSB samples. Compared to the results for HS samples, cultivable lactobacilli increased in HSB fecal samples, while the numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, and Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, and Aeromonas bacteria decreased. Metabolome analyses were performed using an amino acid analyzer and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry solid-phase microextraction. A marked increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as 2-methyl-propanoic, acetic, butyric, and propionic acids, was found in HSB samples with respect to the HS fecal samples. Durum wheat flour and whole-grain barley pasta containing 3{\%} barley beta-glucans appeared to be effective in modulating the composition and metabolic pathways of the intestinal microbiota, leading to an increased level of SCFA in the HSB samples.},

abstract = {beta-Glucans are known to exhibit hypocholesterolemic effects. Increased intestinal viscosity is thought to be crucial for cholesterol lowering. It is suggested that concentration, molecular mass, and structure, including the ratio of (1--{\textgreater}3) to (1--{\textgreater}4) glucan bonds in the molecule, are of importance for beta-glucan functionality. This study investigated the effects of 3 different beta-glucan sources, incorporated into a beverage and yogurt, on blood lipids and fecal endpoints. Fourteen participants completed this randomized, crossover, single-blinded study with four 3-wk periods: control and 3.3 g/d oat, barley, and barley mutant beta-glucans of similar molecular mass. Before and after each period, fasting and postprandial blood samples were drawn and 3-d fecal samples were collected. Treatment did not affect changes in total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol compared with control; however, consumption of 3.3 g/d of oat beta-glucans for 3 wk resulted in greater decreases in total (-0.29 +/- 0.09 mmol/L, P {\textless} 0.01), LDL (-0.23 +/- 0.07 mmol/L, P {\textless} 0.01), and HDL (-0.05 +/- 0.03 mmol/L, P {\textless} 0.05) cholesterol compared with baseline. Changes in LDL in the beta-glucan treatments were not related to beta-glucan structure (cellotriosyl:cellotetraosyl). Decreases in fasting triacylglycerol were substantially greater after oat beta-glucan treatment compared with control (P = 0.03). Fecal dry and wet weight, stool frequency, fecal pH, and energy excretion were unaffected. The results do not fully support the hypocholesterolemic effects by differently structured oat and barley beta-glucans. However, substantial differences compared with baseline suggest a potential for oat beta-glucan, presumably due to its higher solubility and viscosity. This underlines the importance of elusive structural beta-glucan features for beneficial physiologic effects.},

Its distribution is worldwide and is of considerable economic importance for animal feed and alcohol production. The overall importance of barley as a human food is minor but there is much potential for new uses exploiting the health benefits of whole grain and beta-glucans. The barley supply chains are complex and show added value at many stages. Germplasm resources for barley are considerable, with much potential for exploitation of its biodiversity available through the use of recently developed genomic and breeding tools. Consequently, substantial gains in crucial sustainability characteristics should be achievable in the future, together with increased understanding of the physiological basis of many agronomic traits, particularly water and nutrient use efficiency. Barley's ability to adapt to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses will be crucial to its future exploitation and increased emphasis on these traits in elite germplasm is needed to equip the crop for environmental change. Similarly, resource use efficiency should become a higher priority to ensure the crop's sustainability in the long-term. Clearly barley is a resilient crop with much potential which can be realised in the future.},

@article{sterolms,
abstract = {Dietary plant foods are characterized by a vast molecular diversity of glycosylated sterols (SG) that differ in the structure of the steryl backbone. The identification of these polar steryl conjugates represents a major challenge as they are structurally highly similar, and commercial standards are limited to a few naturally abundant species. Spectral databases do not yet contain MS/MS spectra of these sterol conjugates obtained by electrospray ionization (ESI), which would facilitate their reliable identification. Thus, this study aimed at providing novel information on ESI-MS/MS spectra of both abundant and minor SG found in foods. As a first step, however, free sterols (FS) were investigated for their fragmentation behavior as they share the same intermediate ion as SG. Pure SG were obtained from commercially available standard mixtures and minor SG were extracted from different food sources (oat bran, wheat bran, pumpkin seeds, melon, rapeseeds, and potato peel). ESI-MS/MS spectra of 15 FS were assessed and fragment ions reflective of structural features were identified and rationalized. Subsequently, 14 SG were identified at four different levels, while relative retention times from chromatographic separation and spectral features of FS served to identify five SG. Spectral data from FS were directly transferable to SG when analyzed as aglycone ions as shown by similarity scores while SG were characterized by shorter retention times in reverse phase chromatography and the additional analysis as sodiated adduct confirmed their glycosidic nature. Moreover, we report for the first time the occurrence of 24-methylenecholesterol and a 4-monomethyl sterol as glycosidic conjugates in higher plants. The presented data will serve as a valuable tool for SG profiling of foods by facilitating their identification.},

abstract = {Because of the positive health effects of phytosterols, phytosterol-enriched foods and foods containing elevated levels of natural phytosterols are being developed. Phytosterol contents in cereals are moderate, whereas their levels in the outer layers of the kernels are higher. The phytosterols in cereals are currently underutilized; thus, there is a need to create or identify processing fractions that are enriched in phytosterols. In this study, pearling of hulless barley and rye was investigated as a potential process to make fractions with higher levels of phytosterols. The grains were pearled with a laboratory-scale pearler to produce pearling fines and pearled grains. Lipids were extracted by accelerated solvent extraction, and nonpolar lipids were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC with ELSD and UV detection. Total sterol analyses were performed by GC. After a 90-s pearling, the amounts of pearling fines from hulless barley and rye were 14.6 and 20.1{\%}, respectively, of the original kernel weights. During pearling, higher levels of phytosterols and other lipids were fractionated into the fines. The contents of free sterols and sterols esterified with FA in the fines were at least double those in the whole grains. Pearling fines of hulless barley and rye contained {\textgreater}2 mg/g phytosterol compounds, which makes them a good source of phytosterols and thus valuable raw materials for health-promoting foods.},

abstract = {In dietary polyphenol exposure studies, annotation and identification of urinary metabolites present at low (micromolar) concentrations are major obstacles. To determine the biological activity of specific components, it is necessary to have the correct structures and the quantification of the polyphenol-derived conjugates present in the human body. We present a procedure for identification and quantification of metabolites and conjugates excreted in human urine after single bolus intake of black or green tea. A combination of a solid-phase extraction (SPE) preparation step and two high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based analytical platforms was used, namely, accurate mass fragmentation (HPLC-FTMS(n)) and mass-guided SPE-trapping of selected compounds for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) measurements (HPLC-TOFMS-SPE-NMR). HPLC-FTMS(n) analysis led to the annotation of 138 urinary metabolites, including 48 valerolactone and valeric acid conjugates. By combining the results from MS(n) fragmentation with the one-dimensional (1D)-(1)H NMR spectra of HPLC-TOFMS-SPE-trapped compounds, we elucidated the structures of 36 phenolic conjugates, including the glucuronides of 3',4'-di- and 3',4',5'-trihydroxyphenyl-$\gamma$-valerolactone, three urolithin glucuronides, and indole-3-acetic acid glucuronide. We also obtained 26 h-quantitative excretion profiles for specific valerolactone conjugates. The combination of the HPLC-FTMS(n) and HPLC-TOFMS-SPE-NMR platforms results in the efficient identification and quantification of less abundant phenolic conjugates down to nanomoles of trapped amounts of metabolite corresponding to micromolar metabolite concentrations in urine.},

diet for 5 d, and arterial and venous AR concentrations were determined
over 960 min after feeding a single meal of RD. In study 1, plasma AR
concentrations after consuming RD peaked at 120 min, remained elevated
between 120 and 420 min, and were re-elevated on refeeding at 480 min.
In study 2, AR appeared in the plasma after 60 min, peaked at 180-240
min, and remained elevated after 960 min. The apparent elimination
half-life was 3.93 h, and the maximum plasma concentration was 666 (sem
35) nmol/l. Arterial and venous plasma AR concentrations were similar,
suggesting that AR are absorbed via the lymphatic system. AR
concentrations in pig plasma increase rapidly after a meal containing
AR, and persist in plasma for at least 5 d, indicating that AR may be a
useful biomarker of wholegrain wheat and rye intake.},

Objective: The objective was to determine whether plasma AR

influence plasma AR concentrations.
Design: In a randomized parallel-group dietary intervention study, 316
overweight and obese participants with a WG intake of {\textless}30 g/d were
recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: control (no dietary
change), intervention 1 (60 g WG/d for 16 wk), or intervention 2 (60 g
WG/d for 8 wk followed by 120 g WG/d for 8 wk). Fasting blood samples
were collected at baseline, 8 wk, and 16 wk for the measurement of
plasma lipids and ARs.
Results: Plasma samples from 266 study completers were analyzed. Total
plasma AR concentrations increased with the WG intervention and could be
used to distinguish between control subjects and those who consumed 60

AR concentrations were higher in men, were positively associated with
plasma triglyceride concentrations, and were negatively associated with
nonesterified fatty acids.
Conclusions: Plasma AR concentrations were correlated with WG intake and
could be used to distinguish between low- and high-WG consumers. Sex and
plasma lipid concentrations independently influenced plasma AR
concentrations, although plasma triglycerides may explain higher
concentrations in men. This trial is registered as ISRCT no. 83078872.

associations between the AR C17:0/C21:0 ratio, a suggested marker of the
relative intake of whole grain/bran rye, and blood lipid concentrations.
Methods: Participants were 30-65 years of age, with body mass index
(BMI) 27-40 kg/m(2) and had metabolic syndrome. Individuals were
recruited through six centers in the Nordic countries and randomized
either to a healthy Nordic diet (ND, n = 93), rich in whole grain rye

three fish meals per week and low-fat dairy products, or a control diet
(n = 65) for 18/24 weeks. Associations between total plasma AR

investigated in pooled (ND + control group) regression analyses at 18/24
weeks adjusted for baseline value for the dependent variable, age, BMI

Results: When adjusted for confounders, total plasma AR at 18/24 weeks
was not significantly associated with blood lipids but the AR ratio

multivariate analysis was applied to human urine from 155 subjects
stratified by habitual bread consumption in three groups: non-consumers
of bread (n = 56), white-bread consumers (n = 48) and whole-grain bread
consumers (n = 51). The most differential metabolites (variable

compounds originating from cereal plant phytochemicals such as
benzoxazinoids and alkylresorcinol metabolites, and compounds produced
by gut microbiota (such as enterolactones, hydroxybenzoic and
dihydroferulic acid metabolites). Pyrraline, riboflavin,
3-indolecarboxylic acid glucuronide, 2,8-dihydroxyquinoline glucuronide
and N-alpha-acetylcitrulline were also tentatively identified. In order

a stepwise logistic regression analysis was used. Receiver operating

abstract = {Background: Many patients with celiac disease experience difficulties in
adherence to a gluten-free diet. Methods for testing compliance to a
gluten-free diet are costly and cumbersome. Thus, a simple biomarker of
gluten intake is needed in a clinical setting and will be useful for
epidemiologic studies investigating wider effects of gluten intake.
Objective: The aim was to evaluate plasma total alkylresorcinol
concentrations as a measure of gluten intake.
Methods: In this randomized, controlled, crossover intervention study in
52 Danish adults with features of the metabolic syndrome, we compared 8
wk of a gluten-rich and gluten-poor diet separated by a washout period
of wk. We measured fasting plasma concentrations of alkylresorcinols to
determine if they reflected differences in gluten intake as a secondary
outcome of the original study. In addition, we investigated in 118
Danish adults the cross-sectional association between self reported
gluten intake and plasma alkylresorcinols in the same and a similar
study at baseline. We used mixed-model ANCOVA for examining treatment
effects, a classification tree to determine compliance to the
gluten-poor diet, and linear regression models for examining baseline
correlation between plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations and gluten
intake.
Results: Plasma total alkylresorcinols decreased more during the
gluten-poor period (geometric mean: -124.8 nmol/L; 95{\%} CI: -156.5,
-93.0 nmol/L) than in the gluten-rich period (geometric mean: -31.8
nmol/L; 95{\%} CI: -63.1, -0.4 nmol/L) (P {\textless} 0.001). On the basis of the
plasma alkylresorcinol profile, we built a classification tree to
objectively determine compliance and found an overall participant
misclassification error of 3.9{\%}. In the cross-sectional study we found
a 5.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.4{\%}, 8.9{\%}) increase in plasma total
alkylresorcinols per 1-g increase in reported gluten intake (P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion: We propose the use of plasma alkylresorcinols to monitor
compliance to a gluten-free diet as well as to help investigations into
the possible effects of gluten in the wider population. This trial was

associations. Via these integrated approaches, forty-one compounds were
identified as the most discriminating endogenous metabolites after WG
versus refined grain (RG) wheat bread consumption. The corresponding
biological assessment of these endogenous changes suggests that, in
contrast to RG consumption, WG wheat consumption may facilitate
antioxidant defense systems and moderate the risk factors of cancer,
cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic diseases. A panel of urinary
markers consisting of seven alkylresorcinol metabolites and five
benzoxazinoid derivatives as specific biomarkers, as well as five
phenolic acid derivatives, was also established to cover multiple time
points and longer time periods for correctly and objectively monitoring
WG wheat intake. Through these findings, we have established a
comprehensive biomarker pool to better assess WG wheat consumption, and
to monitor the endogenous changes that are linked to health effects of
WG wheat consumption.},

abstract = {ScopeMost studies on the role of whole grain for health rely on
self-reported intake data, which are prone to measurement errors. There
is a need for dietary biomarkers that can provide an objective measure
of intake. Alkylresorcinols (AR) and their main metabolites
3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-propanoic
acid (DHPPA) have been proposed as biomarkers for whole grain (WG) wheat
and rye intake.
Methods and resultsThe medium-term reproducibility and relative validity
of four putative urinary AR metabolites (3,5-dihydroxycinnamic acid
(DHCA), 5-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl) pentanoic acid (DHPPTA),
2-(3,5-dihydroxybenzamido)acetic acid (DHBA-glycine) and
3,5-dihydroxycinnamic acid amide (DHCA-amide)) as biomarkers for WG
intake were investigated. Three-day weighed food records and 24-h urine
samples from two occasions 2-3 months apart were obtained from 69
Swedish adults. WG intake was calculated and urinary AR metabolites were
analyzed. The medium-term reproducibility determined for DHCA, DHPPTA,
and DHBA-glycine varied from moderate-to-excellent (intra-class
correlation coefficient = 0.63-0.85). Moreover, DHCA and DHPPTA
excretion correlated well with self-reported total WG intake (r=0.55,
p{\textless}0.001 and r=0.42, p{\textless}0.001, respectively).
ConclusionDHCA or DHPPTA excretion in 24-h urine might be a suitable
medium- to long-term biomarker of WG wheat and rye intake. These
findings need to be confirmed in populations with low and infrequent WG
intake.},

abstract = {Background/Objectives: Alkylresorcinols (ARs) have been suggested as
specific dietary biomarkers of whole-grain intake. Evaluation of
long-term reliability in repeatedly collected samples in
population-based studies is needed to assess whether plasma AR reflect
long-term exposure and may be used to study exposure-disease
relationships in large-scale epidemiologic studies. The objective of
this study was to analyze the reliability (reproducibility) of AR
concentrations in fasting plasma measured 4 months apart.
Subjects/Methods:AR concentrations (C17:0, C19:0, C21:0, C23:0 and C25:0
and total ARs) were measured in fasting plasma samples from 100
participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam Study with an interval of 4 months between
blood sampling.
Results:Fasting plasma AR concentrations were not significantly
different between the first and second measurement over the 4-month
period. Geometric means of total AR concentrations were 48.8 (95{\%}
confidence interval (CI) 41.5-57.3) nmol/l at the first and 48.7 (95{\%}
CI 41.4-57.4) nmol/l at the second measurement (P = 0.99). The
intraclass correlation coefficients for total AR concentrations were
0.42 (95{\%} CI = 0.25-0.57) for all, 0.55 (95{\%} CI 0.32-0.72) for women,
and 0.17 (95{\%} CI = -0.11-0.42) for men. Comparable results were
obtained for the individual homologues.
Conclusions:Overall, we observed moderate reliability in concentration
of total AR and individual homologues over time, although reliability
was weaker in men than in women. These findings should be taken into
account when using AR as blood biomarkers for whole-grain intake in
large-scale epidemiologic studies. European Journal of Clinical

	abstract = {Evaluation of the health related effects of beer intake is hampered by the lack of accurate tools for assessing intakes (biomarkers). Therefore, we identified plasma and urine metabolites associated with recent beer intake by untargeted metabolomics and established a characteristic metabolite pattern representing raw materials and beer production as a qualitative biomarker of beer intake. In a randomized, crossover, single-blinded meal study (MSt1), 18 participants were given, one at a time, four different test beverages: strong, regular, and nonalcoholic beers and a soft drink. Four participants were assigned to have two additional beers (MSt2). In addition to plasma and urine samples, test beverages, wort, and hops extract were analyzed by UPLC-QTOF. A unique metabolite pattern reflecting beer metabolome, including metabolites derived from beer raw material (i.e., N-methyl tyramine sulfate and the sum of iso-alpha-acids and tricyclohumols) and the production process (i.e., pyro-glutamyl proline and 2-ethyl malate), was selected to establish a compliance biomarker model for detection of beer intake based on MSt1. The model predicted the MSt2 samples collected before and up to 12 h after beer intake correctly (AUC = 1). A biomarker model including four metabolites representing both beer raw materials and production steps provided a specific and accurate tool for measurement of beer consumption.},
