\section{Introduction}
Metabolomics data is characterized as high-dimension, storage space demanding.
In Metabolomics data analysis pipeline, normally different software will be included such as data preprocessing, statistics, annotation and visualization. Different software is programmed in different languages, such as R, java, MatLab or web-based applications.
Different software has different data storage format. This hurdles the data analysis workflow. Because a lot of time will be wasted in converting data format.
As estimated, in data analysis task, 70\% is spent in data preparing.
Therefore, reducing time spent in preparing different format, but focus more in its biological intrepertation will be promising.

\section{Materials and Methods}
We used R programming language, mainly use "tidyverse" package.

\section{Results}
m2r function: This function can convert Pls Toolbox (Eigenvector Research Inc.) to R tidy format.

c2r function: This function can convert MZmine converted '.csv' data to R tidy format.

\section{Discussions}
Definitely this software has a lot of shortcomings: 

\section{Conclusion}
Currently, lacks a bioinformatics tool intergrating all data format converting into one.
Our software can convert
