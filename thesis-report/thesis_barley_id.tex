\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Phytosterol and Fragmentation Behaviour}
Phytosterols ubiquitously occur in plant-based food\cite{sterolmsms}. They were claimed to have health beneficial effects, such as lowering cholesterol. They occur in food as free sterols (FS), steryl esters (SE), and glycosylated conjugates comprised of steryl glucosides (SG) and acylated steryl glucosides (ASG).

Specific sterol profiles characteristic to certain plant families have been identified showing that a broad range ofminor sterols occurs as free sterols or glycosylated conjugates


\section{Materials and methods}
\subsection{Chemicals}
Sitostanol standard (CAS Number 83-45-4, Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., USA) was transported and stored in -20 \degree C. Ethanol

\subsection{Apparatus}
UPLC-MS system (column: C18,  )
QTOF (VION, Waters, Milford, USA)

\subsection{UPLC-MS/MS analysis of Sitostanol}
\cite{doi:10.1021/jf501509m}
Mobile phase A: H2O
Mobile phase B: Methanol

Binary methods developed and optimized 

Analysis methods referred\cite{sterolmsms}. Sitostanol stock solution (1 mg/mL) was prepared in 100\% ethanol. Further, stock solution was diluted by methanol, with the concentration of 0.02 mg/mL. 

ESI positive mode was used to ionize.
