I sincerely acknowledge Gözde Gürdeniz's helpful, patient and detailed supervision for me. She was always available for my questions.

In addition, I acknowledge Lars' coordination job and sharing his knowledge of phytosterols and all fellows from Metabolomics group and all technicians. Without their kind help, I can not successfully finalize my project. I also thank the opponent (censor) Henrik to give his critical comments to the project.

I also thank Simon's Danish knowledge and his generous help in searching for the whole grain cereals. I acknowledge Inge sharing her knowledge and experience on whole grain cereals and Nikolin sharing her knowledge on Chemistry.

In the end, I acknowledge my girlfriend Jingyao, my grandfather Mr. Wang and all other dear family members who live in the time zone 6 or 7 hours ahead of me, but cares every details of my life.

This 15 ECTS project accounts only for 12.5\% of my master study. But it did open the door of a '\textit{brave new world}', Metabolomics, to me.

'O wonder!

How many goodly unknowns are there here!

How beauteous metabolome is! O brave new world,

That has barley in't!'
